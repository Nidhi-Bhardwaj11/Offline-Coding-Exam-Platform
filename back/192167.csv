1,Valid Parentheses,"Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if the brackets are closed in the correct order.","Input: s = ""()"" Output: true Explanation: The brackets are closed in the correct order.","Input: s = ""(]"" Output: false Explanation: The brackets are not closed in the correct order.","Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 104 s consists of parentheses only."
2,Merge Two Sorted Lists,"Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.","Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4] Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]","Input: l1 = [], l2 = [] Output: []","Constraints: The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100. Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order."
3,Climbing Stairs,"You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?","Input: n = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top: 1 step + 1 step or 2 steps.","Input: n = 3 Output: 3 Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top: 1 step + 1 step + 1 step, 1 step + 2 steps, or 2 steps + 1 step.","Constraints: 1 <= n <= 45"
4,Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array,"Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array.","Input: nums = [1,1,2] Output: 2, nums = [1,2]","Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4] Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]","Constraints: 0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104 nums is sorted in ascending order."
5,Maximum Subarray,"Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.","Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] Output: 6 Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.","Input: nums = [1] Output: 1","Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 105 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104"
