1,Find Peak Element,"A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given an integer array nums, find a peak element and return its index. You may assume that the array has multiple peaks.","Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 2 Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.","Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Your function can return either index 1 where the peak element is 2, or index 5 where the peak element is 6.","Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 1000 -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1 nums[i] != nums[i+1] for all valid i."
2,Permutations,"Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.","Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]","Input: nums = [0,1] Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]","Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 6 -10 <= nums[i] <= 10 All the integers of nums are unique."
3,House Robber,"You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.","Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 4 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).","Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1] Output: 12 Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9), and rob house 5 (money = 1).","Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 100 -10 <= nums[i] <= 400."
4,Merge Intervals,"Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.","Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]] Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].","Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]] Output: [[1,5]] Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.","Constraints: 1 <= intervals.length <= 104 intervals[i].length == 2 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104."
5,Coin Change,"You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money. Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.","Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11 Output: 3 Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1.","Input: coins = [2], amount = 3 Output: -1","Constraints: 1 <= coins.length <= 12 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1 0 <= amount <= 104."
