1,Two Sum,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.","Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].","Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 Output: [0,1]",2 <= nums.length <= 104 -109 <= nums[i] <= 109 -109 <= target <= 109 Only one valid answer exists.
2,Median of Two Sorted Arrays,"Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).","Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2] Output: 2.00000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.","Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4] Output: 2.50000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.","nums1.length == m nums2.length == n 0 <= m <= 1000 0 <= n <= 1000 1 <= m + n <= 2000 -106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106"
3,Longest Palindromic Substring,"Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.","Input: s = ""babad"" Output: ""bab"" Explanation: ""aba"" is also a valid answer.","Input: s = ""cbbd"" Output: ""bb""",Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 1000 s consist of only digits and English letters
4,Palindrome Number,"Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.",Input: x = 121 Output: true Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.,"Input: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.",Constraints: -231 <= x <= 231 - 1 Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
5,Longest Common Prefix,"Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string """".","Input: strs = [""flower"",""flow"",""flight""] Output: ""fl""","Input: strs = [""dog"",""racecar"",""car""] Output: """" Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.",Constraints: 1 <= strs.length <= 200 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200 strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters
