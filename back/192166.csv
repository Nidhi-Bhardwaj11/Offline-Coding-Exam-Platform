1,Reverse Integer,"Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.","Input: x = 123 Output: 321","Input: x = -123 Output: -321","Constraints: -231 <= x <= 231 - 1"
2,Container With Most Water,"You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines which, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds the most water.","Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] Output: 49","Input: height = [1,1] Output: 1","Constraints: n == height.length 2 <= n <= 105 0 <= height[i] <= 104"
3,Find the Duplicate Number,"Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive, return the duplicate number.","Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2] Output: 2","Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2] Output: 3","Constraints: 1 <= n <= 105 nums.length == n + 1 1 <= nums[i] <= n All the integers in nums appear only once except for exactly one integer which appears twice."
4,Search in Rotated Sorted Array,"Given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values), and given that nums is possibly rotated, search for a given target in nums and return its index. If not found, return -1.","Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0 Output: 4","Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3 Output: -1","Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 5000 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104 All values of nums are unique."
5,Product of Array Except Self,"Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.","Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] Output: [24,12,8,6]","Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3] Output: [0,0,9,0,0]","Constraints: 2 <= nums.length <= 105 -30 <= nums[i] <= 30 The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer."
