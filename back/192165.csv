1,Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock,"You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.","Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.","Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1] Output: 0 Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done, and the max profit is 0.","Constraints: 1 <= prices.length <= 105 0 <= prices[i] <= 104"
2,Linked List Cycle,"Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. If there is a cycle, return true, otherwise return false.","Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 Output: true","Input: head = [1], pos = -1 Output: false","Constraints: The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104]. -105 <= Node.val <= 105."
3,Group Anagrams,"Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.","Input: strs = [""eat"",""tea"",""tan"",""ate"",""nat"",""bat""] Output: [[""eat"",""tea"",""ate""],[""tan"",""nat""],[""bat""]]","Input: strs = [""""] Output: [["""""]]","Constraints: 1 <= strs.length <= 104 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100 strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters."
4,Subsets,"Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).","Input: nums = [1,2,3] Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]","Input: nums = [0] Output: [[],[0]]","Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 10 -10 <= nums[i] <= 10 All the numbers of nums are unique."
5,Binary Tree Inorder Traversal,"Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.","Input: root = [1,null,2,3] Output: [1,3,2]","Input: root = [] Output: []","Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100."
